    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Data-Science-Methodologies-—-CRISP-DM"><a href="#Data-Science-Methodologies-—-CRISP-DM" class="headerlink" title="Data Science Methodologies — CRISP-DM"></a>Data Science Methodologies — CRISP-DM</h1><p> In data mining, the Cross Industry Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology is widely used.</p><h2 id="What-is-CRISP-DM"><a href="#What-is-CRISP-DM" class="headerlink" title="What is CRISP-DM?"></a>What is CRISP-DM?</h2><p>The CRISP-DM methodology is a process aimed at increasing the use of data mining over a wide variety of business applications and industries. The intent is to take case specific scenarios and general behaviors to make them domain neutral. CRISP-DM is comprised of six steps with an entity that has to implement in order to have a reasonable chance of success. The six steps are shown in the following diagram:</p><p><img src="https://github.com/zhaodianwen/FigureBed/raw/master/crisp_process.jpg" alt=""></p><ol><li><strong>Business Understanding</strong> This stage is the most important because this is where the intention of the project is outlined. Foundational Methodology and CRISP-DM are aligned here. It requires communication and clarity. The difficulty here is that stakeholders have different objectives, biases, and modalities of relating information. They don’t all see the same things or in the same manner. Without clear, concise, and complete perspective of what the project goals are resources will be needlessly expended. </li><li><strong>Data Understanding</strong> Data understanding relies on business understanding. Data is collected at this stage of the process. The understanding of what the business wants and needs will determine what data is collected, from what sources, and by what methods. CRISP-DM combines the stages of Data Requirements, Data Collection, and Data Understanding from the Foundational Methodology outline. </li><li><strong>Data Preparation</strong> Once the data has been collected, it must be transformed into a useable subset unless it is determined that more data is needed. Once a dataset is chosen, it must then be checked for questionable, missing, or ambiguous cases. Data Preparation is common to CRISP-DM and Foundational Methodology. </li><li><strong>Modeling</strong> Once prepared for use, the data must be expressed through whatever appropriate models, give meaningful insights, and hopefully new knowledge. This is the purpose of data mining: to create knowledge information that has meaning and utility. The use of models reveals patterns and structures within the data that provide insight into the features of interest. Models are selected on a portion of the data and adjustments are made if necessary. Model selection is an art and science. Both Foundational Methodology and CRISP-DM are required for the subsequent stage. </li><li><strong>Evaluation</strong> The selected model must be tested. This is usually done by having a pre-selected test, set to run the trained model on. This will allow you to see the effectiveness of the model on a set it sees as new. Results from this are used to determine efficacy of the model and foreshadows its role in the next and final stage. </li><li><strong>Deployment</strong> In the deployment step, the model is used on new data outside of the scope of the dataset and by new stakeholders. The new interactions at this phase might reveal the new variables and needs for the dataset and model. These new challenges could initiate revision of either business needs and actions, or the model and data, or both.</li></ol><p>P.S.</p><p><strong>CRISP-DM is a highly flexible and cyclical model.</strong> Flexibility is required at each step along with communication to keep the project on track. At any of the six stages, it may be necessary to revisit an earlier stage and make changes. The key point of this process is that it’s cyclical; therefore, even at the finish you are having another business understanding encounter to discuss the viability after deployment. The journey continues. </p>]]></content>

    <title>ML#2 Linear Regression with One Variable</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Model-Representation"><a href="#Model-Representation" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation"></a>Model Representation</h2><p>Recall that in regression problems, we are taking input variables and trying to fit the output onto a continuous expected result function.</p><p>Linear regression with one variable is also known as “univariate linear regression.”</p><p>Univariate linear regression is used when you want to predict a single output value y from a single input value x. We’re doing supervised learning here, so that means we already have an idea about what the input/output cause and effect should be.</p><h2 id="The-Hypothesis-Function"><a href="#The-Hypothesis-Function" class="headerlink" title="The Hypothesis Function"></a>The Hypothesis Function</h2><p>Our hypothesis function has the general form:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{y}=h_θ(x)=θ_0+θ_1x</script><p>Note that this is like the equation of a straight line. We give to $h<em>\θ(x)$ values for $\θ_0$ and $\θ_1$ to get our estimated output $\hat{y}$. In other words, we are trying to create a function called $h</em>\θ$ that is trying to map our input data (the x’s) to our output data (the y’s).</p><blockquote><p><em>Example:</em><br>Suppose we have the following set of training data:</p></blockquote><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">input x</th><th style="text-align:center">output y</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">0</td><td style="text-align:center">4</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">1</td><td style="text-align:center">7</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:center">7</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3</td><td style="text-align:center">8</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now we can make a random guess about our $h<em>\θ$ function: $\θ_0=2$ and $\θ_1=2$. The hypothesis function becomes $h</em>\θ(x)=2+2x$.</p><p>So for input of 1 to our hypothesis, y will be 4. This is off by 3. Note that we will be trying out various values of $\θ_0$ and $\θ_1$ to try to find values which provide the best possible “fit” or the most representative “straight line” through the data points mapped on the <em>x-y</em> plane.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-is-Machine-Learning"><a href="#What-is-Machine-Learning" class="headerlink" title="What is Machine Learning"></a>What is Machine Learning</h2><p>Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” This is an older, informal definition.</p><p>Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”</p><blockquote><p><em>Example:</em> playing checkers.<br>E = the experience of playing many games of checkers<br>T = the task of playing checkers.<br>P = the probability that the program will win the next game.</p></blockquote><p>In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:</p><blockquote><ul><li>supervised learning, OR</li><li>unsupervised learning.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="Supervised-Learning"><a href="#Supervised-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Supervised Learning"></a>Supervised Learning</h3><p>In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.</p><p>Supervised learning problems are categorized into “regression” and “classification” problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. Here is a description on Math is Fun on Continuous and Discrete Data.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example 1:</em><br>Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.</p></blockquote><p>We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house “sells for more or less than the asking price.” Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example 2:</em></p><ul><li>Regression:<br>Given a picture of Male/Female, We have to predict his/her age on the basis of given picture.</li><li>Classification:<br>Given a picture of Male/Female, We have to predict Whether He/She is of High school, College, Graduate age. Another Example for Classification - Banks have to decide whether or not to give a loan to someone on the basis of his credit history.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="Unsupervised-Learning"><a href="#Unsupervised-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Unsupervised Learning"></a>Unsupervised Learning</h3><p>Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don’t necessarily know the effect of the variables.</p><p>We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.</p><p>With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results, i.e., there is no teacher to correct you.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example:</em></p><ul><li>Clustering:<br>Take a collection of 1000 essays written on the US Economy, and find a way to automatically group these essays into a small number that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as word frequency, sentence length, page count, and so on.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Non-clustering:<br>The “Cocktail Party Algorithm”, which can find structure in messy data (such as the identification of individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference#1</a>). Here is an answer on Quora to enhance your understanding: <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-algorithms?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference#2</a></li></ul></blockquote>]]></content>
